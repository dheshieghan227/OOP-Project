## SECTION A: PROJECT DESCRIPTION

### 1. Problem Statement and Project Overview

Although online applications and platforms have been widely embraced for book purchases and inventory management, small-town or rural bookshops still depend on conventional, face-to-face interactions. One such bookstore is **Kamal Book Store**.

Mr. Kamal faces many challenges in uplifting his bookstore sales and managing store operations efficiently. He currently uses manual filing to keep track of book records, stock quantity, customer details, and restocking schedules. This results in inventory discrepancies, out-of-stock issues, and difficulties in forecasting demand — ultimately affecting customer satisfaction and business growth.

To address these issues, we propose the **Kamal BookStore Inventory Management System** — a user-friendly and efficient system tailored to streamline the daily operations of Kamal Book Store.
